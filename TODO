TODO notes:

Still to address bank ddl positioning near display edges

Deal with Window Manager issues of oddities, include no WM also.

Compiz behaves well. Focus retained by source. Raises windows underneath pointer.
On drop, leaves raised/focus of window. On cancel, raised/focus on source.
no wm behaves well. same as Compiz.
twm behaves well.    Focus retained by source. Raises windows underneath pointer.
Drop/Cancel, raised/focus to window underneath pointer (focus by pointer).
GNOME Shell blocks raise window, dnd. Only allows within a multi-window app.
Otherwise enforces raise by focus only. Can not see drops, forced to pre-arrange
windows.

Re-test w/o cursor inherits on Xcursors only

need to go thru textuals.c to increase offsets from int to unsigned size ???

on auto scroll possible static time variable like mouse bptime
draw.c still needs dirty/clean compositing instead of draw all

current _default_bank_meter() based on combo button, not actual actuator
XXX: banks currently only set up is horizontal object layout.
     and postion/scroll need setup based on position on screen
./objects.c:243:      /* XXX: one directional bank set up. */
./banks.c:31:       /* XXX: need binary compat
think fixed:  with combo/focus issue of drag_selection_box

./textviews_drag.c:242:  /* XXX tbuf in otxt */
./textviews_drag.c:342:  /* XXX should verify gdata type */

./drag.c:45:        /* XXX TODO a dash-lined rectangle for selection */
./nexus.c:9:        /* XXX add visiblity */
./buttons.c:333:    /* XXX add visiblity */
./textuals.c:535:   /* XXX location_double_click() c parse of parenthesis, etc
./textviews.c:22:   /* XXX: Draw background. Plain backdrop only set up for.
./events.c:511:     /* XXX: focus. */

drawing port/nexus: a container of objects that receive events
bank: a dropdown interface normally contains one nexus. Could contain
      more to switch out content (Menus?). The nexus metes out to its objects.

session: a collection of windows and data needed at this global level
interface: collection of drawing ports/nexus to a window and this
           level's data. Auto-configures on window resize.
           Sends events to its objects.
objects: drawing/events that occur within a port and its data. Must attach
         to a nexus or another object as child.

events: broken into 2 types, basic signals and a motion with button 1 press.
        motion with button 1 press are separated into 'drag' files.

drag: 6 different types:
      within an object (selecting and dnd)
      object to object in same window           INTERNAL_ON
      window to window within an application    EXTERNAL_ON
      application window to application window  EXTERNAL_ON
      gfuse, kind of window within a window that resizes (own seperate file)
      7th added:
        excluded ??? from normal as it is for headerbars, the move/resize
        is simular to gfuse?
drag: session holds servers created
      atoms holds needed server constants
      drag.c holds links/servers to normal signals:
        3 sections, normal, internal, external
      textviews_drag.c holds this object's needs
      gfuse.c holds it use of signals/drag

dropdown/combo:
      Compiz WM has flicker of content within the button. Math verified, gcc
      verified (older version built on different system), and 'GNOME Shell' WM
      provides non-flicker results.

Inclusion status requests of DND not handled (not sure should include)
Drag objects test

/* src_actions :
 XdndActionCopy    0
 XdndActionMove    1  possible user actions? meaning part of position/status
 XdndActionLink    2  Unknown abstract, add private unicode characters?
 XdndActionAsk     4  source run dialog for user input (keyboardless?)
 XdndActionPrivate 8  Unknown abstract, add private unicode characters?
*/

Bank must have a first member?
menu: actavator
combo: active
context: none
tooltip: location selection activator

Right-click context dropdown: owner iface, non-attached
left-clicked button (menu): owner button, attached lower left
left-clicked button (combo): owner button, attached button-draw area
left-clicked button (free): owner button, user defined position

Work clipboard, feel like missing something
