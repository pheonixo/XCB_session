TODO notes:

On no-WM, can't switch focus to a non-XCB_session application.
This includes GDB.

Strobing/flickering solved by bit gravity added to window.
Not sure if this a bandaid?!?
Stobing of content now occurs because of speed refinements to WM resize.
Added configure timer to resize. Stopped spamming of X server. Small
stutter improvement.

no wm test:
cd /home/steven/Development/Projects/XCB_session
./xxtv1 & P1=$! ./xxtxt & P2=$! ./xxgtx & P3=$! wait $P1 $P2 $P3

with output for wm tests
/home/steven/Development/Projects/XCB_session/xxtv1 | tee ../xxtv1.ouput & \
P1=$! /home/steven/Development/Projects/XCB_session/xxtxt | tee ../xxtxt.ouput & \
P2=$! /home/steven/Development/Projects/XCB_session/xxgtx | tee ../xxgtx.ouput & \
P3=$! wait $P1 $P2 $P3

Still to address bank ddl positioning near display edges

Deal with Window Manager issues of oddities, include no WM also.
When using headerbar with WM titlebar, functions work but occassional glitches
can appear. As far as I can tell, they are due to WM. REMINDER: not designed to
be used like that and if want spot placement availablity, looks like need bug
reports filed to WMs will be required.
MOVING, MAXIMIZE:
Can not use _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE on a override-redirect. WM must own window, so
must have _MOTIF_WM_HINTS to create an undecorated window, which will allow WM
control, allowing _NET_WM_MOVERESIZE.
MINIMIZE:
This is a wildcard. Still needs work as default of shading might not be solution.
STACKING:
Compiz behaves ok. More like follow by pointer. Raise position not neccessarily
the focused window.
no-wm and twm behaves perfectly. But no-wm uses focus on click between apps.
GNOME Shell near perfect, but windows stack in order of first created as oppose
to mapping order.
DND:
Compiz behaves well. Focus retained by source. Raises windows underneath pointer.
On drop, leaves raised/focus of window. On cancel, raised/focus on source.
no wm behaves well. same as Compiz.
twm behaves well.    Focus retained by source. Raises windows underneath pointer.
Drop/Cancel, raised/focus to window underneath pointer (focus by pointer).
GNOME Shell blocks raise window, dnd. Only allows raise within a multi-window app.
Otherwise enforces raise by focus only. Can not see drops, forced to pre-arrange
windows.

Re-test w/o cursor inherits on Xcursors only

need to go thru textuals.c to increase offsets from int to unsigned size ???

on auto scroll possible static time variable like mouse bptime
draw.c still needs dirty/clean compositing instead of draw all

current _default_bank_meter() based on combo button, not actual actuator
XXX: banks currently only set up is horizontal object layout.
     and postion/scroll need setup based on position on screen
./objects.c:243:      /* XXX: one directional bank set up. */
./banks.c:31:       /* XXX: need binary compat
think fixed:  with combo/focus issue of drag_selection_box

./textviews_drag.c:242:  /* XXX tbuf in otxt */
./textviews_drag.c:342:  /* XXX should verify gdata type */

./drag.c:45:        /* XXX TODO a dash-lined rectangle for selection */
./nexus.c:9:        /* XXX add visiblity */
./buttons.c:333:    /* XXX add visiblity */
./textuals.c:535:   /* XXX location_double_click() c parse of parenthesis, etc
./textviews.c:22:   /* XXX: Draw background. Plain backdrop only set up for.
./events.c:511:     /* XXX: focus. */

drawing port/nexus: a container of objects that receive events
bank: a dropdown interface normally contains one nexus. Could contain
      more to switch out content (Menus?). The nexus metes out to its objects.

session: a collection of windows and data needed at this global level
interface: collection of drawing ports/nexus to a window and this
           level's data. Auto-configures on window resize.
           Sends events to its objects.
objects: drawing/events that occur within a port and its data. Must attach
         to a nexus or another object as child.

events: broken into 2 types, basic signals and a motion with button 1 press.
        motion with button 1 press are separated into 'drag' files.

drag: 6 different types:
      within an object (selecting and dnd)
      object to object in same window           INTERNAL_ON
      window to window within an application    EXTERNAL_ON
      application window to application window  EXTERNAL_ON
      gfuse, kind of window within a window that resizes (own seperate file)
      7th added:
        excluded ??? from normal as it is for headerbars, the move/resize
        is simular to gfuse?
drag: session holds servers created
      atoms holds needed server constants
      drag.c holds links/servers to normal signals:
        3 sections, normal, internal, external
      textviews_drag.c holds this object's needs
      gfuse.c holds it use of signals/drag

dropdown/combo:
      Compiz WM has flicker of content within the button. Math verified, gcc
      verified (older version built on different system), and 'GNOME Shell' WM
      provides non-flicker results.

Inclusion status requests of DND not handled (not sure should include)
Drag objects test

/* src_actions :
 XdndActionCopy    0
 XdndActionMove    1  possible user actions? meaning part of position/status
 XdndActionLink    2  Unknown abstract, add private unicode characters?
 XdndActionAsk     4  source run dialog for user input (keyboardless?)
 XdndActionPrivate 8  Unknown abstract, add private unicode characters?
*/

Bank must have a first member?
menu: actavator
combo: active
context: none
tooltip: location selection activator

Right-click context dropdown: owner iface, non-attached
left-clicked button (menu): owner button, attached lower left
left-clicked button (combo): owner button, attached button-draw area
left-clicked button (free): owner button, user defined position

Work clipboard, feel like missing something

Repeated here from above for 'cat' when running twm
cd /home/steven/Development/Projects/XCB_session
./xxtv1 & P1=$! ./xxtxt & P2=$! ./xxgtx & P3=$! wait $P1 $P2 $P3
